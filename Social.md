# Social Science through interdisciplinary lens
</div>

- Social science essentially is the study of humanity ‚ù§Ô∏è
    - thus impossible to study without an interdisciplinary approach
    - myriad of social problems‚òî
- disciplinary organisation is to distribute goalsüßê

------

- examining the roles of persons (sociology), 
- their motivations (psychology), 
- where they lived (geography), 
- the influences of spiritual beliefs (religion), üïå
- rules that govern behavior (political science and anthropology),
- how people negotiate for their needs and wants (economics)

- connection to languages, arts, science, and mathematics

-----

## Why?
- eliminates close mindedness stemming from pre-conceived notions
- allows students to solve problems on their own through checking for subject specific biases
- improves cognitive abilities (Miller, 2002)üß†
- analytical framework based approaches are never enough for addressing social issues
- popular ideas/fields outshine need based approaches

-----

## Criticism
- directed more towards broadening scope 
- lacks emphasis on goal oriented specialisation
