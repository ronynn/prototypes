# Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligence through a 21st century perspective.

*Intelligence*
> "a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."

------

Within his paradigm of intelligence, Gardner defines it as being "the ability to learn" or "to solve problems," referring to intelligence as a "bio-psychological potential to process information"

- modalities of intelligence, rather than a general ability
- there is always a dominant or primary form
- complains about learning being too focussed on linguistics and logical quantities
- shaped educational pedagogy
- learning through movement in the classroom environment



-------
## Modalities

- Musical-rhythmic and harmonic
- Visual-spatial
- Linguistic-verbal
- Logical-mathematical
- Bodily-kinesthetic
- Interpersonal ( has equated this with emotional intelligence of Goleman.)
- Intrapersonal

--------

- Naturalistic 
> "sensitive, ethical, and holistic understanding" of the world and its complexities – including the role of humanity within the greater ecosphere."
- Existential
- Teaching-pedagogical intelligence


------

A 2006 study claims that each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general g factor, cognitive abilities other than g, and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics
But correlation between the g factor and "inductive speed" is only 0.5, considered a moderate correlation.

## Criticisms

- lack of empirical evidence 
- dependence on subjective judgement
- some have suggested that the 'intelligences' refer to talents, personality, or ability rather than a distinct form of intelligence.

- Gardner's own criticism on the use of the theory in teacher training curriculums
    - opposes the idea of assigning learners to specific intelligence
    - it should empower learners rather than restrict them

- Low correlations between intelligences, opposite of psychometrics
- His definition is more suited to the term aptitude or ability, further debates are essential
    - his views on intelligence are too broad
- Perry D. Klein: so unclear that it's tautologous and thus unfalsifiable
- Neo-Piagetian criticism - MI underestimates various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency
- MI argues against IQ tests (Linda Gottfredson, 2006)
